               <h1>All About Me</h1>
               
               <h2> Hello! I’m Honey Latcha, a programmer based in the Philippines. I am currently studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Northern Bukidnon State College where I have developed a passion for web development.
                From an early age, I was intrigued by the characteristic and influence of professional programmers I've known. This led me to pursue this bachelor and planned to proceed to be a network engineer.
                Currently, I am focused on finishing my degree, web development plans and my internship. I believe in willingness to work with me, and I am committed to your aspirations to become a programmer someday.</h2>
                <h2>I love connecting with like-minded individuals! Feel free to reach out to me through gracelatcha@gmail.com.</h2>
