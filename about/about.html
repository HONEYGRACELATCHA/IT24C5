        <h2> Hello! Iâ€™m Honey Latcha, a programmer based in the Philippines. I am currently studying Bachelor of Science
            in Information Technology at Northern Bukidnon State College where I have developed a passion for web
            development.
            From an early age, I was intrigued by the characteristic and influence of professional programmers I've
            known. This led me to pursue this bachelor and planned to proceed to be a network engineer.
            Currently, I am focused on finishing my degree, web development plans and my internship. I believe in
            willingness to work with me, and I am committed to your aspirations to become a programmer someday.</h2>
